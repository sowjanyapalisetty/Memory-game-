# Memory Game Project

## About Game
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

## Rules 
The gameplay rules are very simple: 
* flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
Each turn:
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched

## Game Functionality
The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in this project. There are a couple of interactions that need to be handled.
* Flipping cards
* What happens when cards match
* What happens when cards do not match
* When the game finishes

## How to do 
* created deck of cards that shuffles everytime when the game is loaded
* created a counter to count number of moves
* time to calculate the duration of the play
* created functions to check whether cards match or unmatch
* Finally a popup modal to display player game details
